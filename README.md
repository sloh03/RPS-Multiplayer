## The Game
Find an opponent and open the link to the game from separate devices. Enter your names and press 'Start' to begin. Player one will go first and choose rock, paper, or scissors. Then player two will choose. The game displays a status informing the player of their turn. After both players have chosen their weapon, the display will update with the winner of the game. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper. If both players choose the same weapon, they tie. The game will keep track and display the wins and losses for each player.

At any time, the players are able to communicate using the messenger system at the bottom of the page. For each player, the messages sent are displayed in blue, and the messages received are displayed in red.
